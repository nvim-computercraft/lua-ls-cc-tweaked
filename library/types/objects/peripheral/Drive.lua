---Disk drives are a peripheral which allow you to read and write to floppy
---disks and other "mountable media" (such as computers or turtles). They also
---allow you to play records.
---
---When a disk drive attaches some mount (such as a floppy disk or computer), it
---attaches a folder called disk, disk2, etc... to the root directory of the
---computer. This folder can be used to interact with the files on that disk.
---
---When a disk is inserted, a `disk` event is fired, with the side peripheral is
---on. Likewise, when the disk is detached, a `disk_eject` event is fired.
