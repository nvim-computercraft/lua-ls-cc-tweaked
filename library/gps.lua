---Using modems and computers, you can find the GPS coordinates of other computers/turtles in the world.
---
---This functions by broadcasting a `PING` message over rednet and waiting for responses. For this to work, there must be at least 4 computers with modems to allow trilateration. Three of the computers should be in the same plane but form a triangle and not all be in a line. The fourth computer must be above or below the other three computers.
---
---You can set up a GPS host using the `gps` program. The program requires the `x`, `y`, `z` of the host **computer** not modem.
---
---You can choose which axes `x`, `y`, `z` refer to, just make sure that you are consistent with your usage.
